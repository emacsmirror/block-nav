## block-nav.el

I made this after seeing this post on reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/izwrlf/anyone_using_spatial_navigation_in_emacs/

Mostly it just looks like a really neat way of navigating code. 

## Things to add:
- A function that will jump to the next line with a deeper indentation than the current one?
