;;; Commentary:
;; Provides a number of interactive functions for easily navigating
;; between blocks of code at the same level of indentation.
;;
;; This package does not bind any keys for you. 
;; Here are some example bindings for evil-mode:
;;
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "H" 'block-nav-previous-indentation-level)
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "J" 'block-nav-next-block)
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "K" 'block-nav-previous-block)
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "L" 'block-nav-next-indentation-level)
;;
;;   ;; Although this may not be desireable since it overrides vim keys you may use.
;;
;;; Code:

(defvar block-nav-center-after-scroll t)

(defun block-nav-move-block (dir original-column)
  (interactive)
  (forward-line dir)
  (back-to-indentation)
  (cond ((< original-column (current-column))
         (block-nav-move-block dir original-column))
        ((string-empty-p (buffer-substring (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)))
         (block-nav-move-block dir original-column))
        (t (when block-nav-center-after-scroll
             (recenter)))))

(defun block-nav-next-block ()
  (interactive)
  (block-nav-move-block 1 (current-column)))

(defun block-nav-previous-block ()
  (interactive)
  (block-nav-move-block -1 (current-column)))
